![](https://github.com/Prakashpsk/Vegetable-Price-Prediction-/blob/main/grainprices-header.png)

## Introduction
Struggling with daily price fluctuations in agriculture, farmers need predictive solutions to anticipate when prices will rise or fall. This project aims to empower farmers by providing them with actionable insights into price trends, helping to increase their income significantly.

## 🚀 Skills/Concepts Developed
- 🌐 **Machine Learning**: Supervised algorithms to predict price fluctuations.
- 🧠 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw agricultural data.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and understanding seasonal price movements.
- 🤖 **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing regression models for price forecasting.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Farmers face unpredictable price fluctuations, making it challenging to plan production and sales strategies effectively. Our solution predicts future price movements, enabling informed decision-making for better profit margins.

## 🌟 Impact of Your Work
By providing accurate price predictions, this project:
- Helps farmers increase their income by strategically selling crops.
- Reduces the risks of financial losses due to market volatility.
- Promotes better planning of agricultural activities and crop storage.

## 🔧 Modeling
### Steps:
1. 📂 **Data Collection**: Aggregated historical data on agricultural prices.
2. 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and standardization.
3. 🧮 **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features to enhance model performance.
4. 🏋️‍♂️ **Model Training**: Applied and fine-tuned regression models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
5. 📈 **Model Evaluation**: Assessed accuracy using R-squared and MSE metrics.

## 📊 Visualization
Visualized price trends and model predictions using:
- 🌾 **Time-Series Plots**: Highlighting seasonal changes in prices.
- 📉 **Regression Line Charts**: Illustrating the fit of predictive models.
- 🗺️ **Geographical Plots**: Showing price variations across regions.

## 💡 Conclusion
This project provides a practical solution for farmers to predict agricultural prices, enabling them to make better decisions about when to sell their products for maximum profit.

## 📢 Recommendations
- ⚙️ **Further Model Optimization**: Fine-tune models using advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques.
- 🌍 **Expand Dataset**: Include more geographical regions and crop types for better accuracy.
- 📲 **Deploy as an App**: Develop a mobile app to provide real-time price forecasts to farmers.
